# NLP-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, NLP: Twitter Sentiment Analysis, we're going to train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets.<br>

This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not).<br>

The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews.

• Business Problem: To understand people feelings about a product or service (i.e. whether customers happy or not) <br>

• Solution: Build, train, test and deploy an Artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict sentiment from thousands of tweets. <br>

• Model: Naïve Bayes classifier models <br>
 
• Tools: Anaconda, Python, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn <br>

• Advantage: The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets/reviews. <br>
